initial site thoughts
-----------------------------------

-Sleek black homepage with big white melody realm logo.

-links for all MR albums ie MRI MRII MRIII etc
  -popup on hover to show release date and shit (maybe not unless it looks sleek as fuck)

-links for all main artists
  -artist links contain bio, follow on souncloud option, artist logo and shit..

-most played tracks recommendations?
